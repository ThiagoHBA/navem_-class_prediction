## What is Navem?
**Navem** was born due to the great difficulty that visually impaired people face
every day. Its objective is to facilitate the movement of these individuals in urban areas and ensure that such people can have their life easier.

### The System
To fulfill its main objective, Navem uses deep learning algorithms to detect obstacles in images. With architectures such as RestNet, Vgg16, Dronet,
it uses a dataset loaded with images categorized with gyroscope and accelerometer data. The repository for data capture and dataset generation can be
found right here at the following link: https://github.com/ThiagoHBA/navem

The full example of using Navem in a **No Stream** video can be seen at the following link: https://youtu.be/REyySHAWXmw

This repository seeks to deal and make predictions with the weights generated by these neural networks and uses an image capture in the form of a **stream** with libraries such as **Opencv** and **PiCamera**, these are used to capture the images, adjust your size for the CNN architecture used and modify its color scale.

After this classification of images, signals are used that will be sent to the vibracall sensors to indicate to the walker in which direction he should move and with what intensity he should make this movement.

## Technologies Used In This Repository

### Python
* TensorFlow/Keras to compile the weights.
* OpenCV to get the images and resize to a specific CNN architecture.
* PiCamera to get the images in a NAVEM device.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies
At your command prompt run:
* `pip install opencv-python`
* `pip install keras`
* `pip install tensorflow`

### Running Application
* Install python following its official document: https://www.python.org/downloads/
