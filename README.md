## What is Navem?
**Navem** was born due to the great difficulty that visually impaired people face
every day. Its objective is to facilitate the movement of these individuals in urban areas and ensure that such people can have their life easier.

### The System
To fulfill its main objective, Navem uses deep learning algorithms to detect obstacles in images. With architectures such as RestNet, Vgg16, Dronet,
it uses a dataset loaded with images categorized with gyroscope and accelerometer data. The repository for data capture and dataset generation can be
found right here at the following link: https://github.com/ThiagoHBA/navem
